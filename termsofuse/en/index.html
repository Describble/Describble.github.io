    ▪️Purchases and Automatically Renewing Subscriptions
</h2>
<div style="font-size:30px">
    <p>
        Flixcribir may offer products and services for purchase through App Store. 
        <strong>
            If you purchase a subscription to Flixcribir Pro, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further described below.
        </strong>
        If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point you will no longer have access.
    </p>
    <p>Please Note:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                Subscription Free Trials are offered to new users so they can try out our pro features with all the perks it brings!
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                If you have a free trial period, the subscription will automatically convert into a paid auto-renewing subscription at the end of the trial period.
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>
                If you are not eligible for the free trial (for instance, if you already used Flixcribir Pro), you will be charged immediately.
            </strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When making a purchase on the Application, you may have the option to pay through your Apple ID, and your account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your account. Depending on where you live, you may be charged sales tax, which may change from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Your purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription. Your Apple account will continue to be charged for the subscription, based on your subscription plan, until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the current price of the Flixcribir Pro term that subscribed to.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            To cancel a subscription:
        </strong>
         If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your Apple ID and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not Flixcribir. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to 
         <strong>
            Settings &gt; [click on your Apple ID] &gt; Subscriptions
        </strong>
        , then find your Flixcribir subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com">https://getsupport.apple.com</a>. If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the canceled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flixcribir does not handle refunds for subscriptions as it is entirely dependent on App Store policy.
